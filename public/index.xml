      <description>The problems ended up being more mathematical than I was originally expecting from an introductory textbook, but I believe I succesfully managed to navigate them..
Exercises Exercise 1.9
Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.
(define (+ a b) (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b)))) (define (+ a b) (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b)))) Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5).</description>

      <description>As to be expected from the introduction of an introductory book, things started out fairly straightforward and I don’t think I had any major problems with this chapter.
Exercises Exercise 1.1
Below is a sequence of expressions. What is the result printed by the interpreter in response to each expression? Assume that the sequence is to be evaluated in the order in which it is presented.
10 ;10 (+ 5 3 4) ;12 (- 9 1) ;8 (/ 6 2) ;3 (+ (* 2 4) (- 4 6)) ;6 (define a 3) ;a (define b (+ a 1)) ;b (+ a b (* a b)) ;19 (= a b) ;#f (if (and (&amp;gt; b a) (&amp;lt; b (* a b))) b a) ;4 (cond ((= a 4) 6) ((= b 4) (+ 6 7 a)) (else 25)) ;16 (+ 2 (if (&amp;gt; b a) b a)) ;6 (* (cond ((&amp;gt; a b) a) ((&amp;lt; a b) b) (else -1)) (+ a 1))	;16 Exercise 1.</description>
